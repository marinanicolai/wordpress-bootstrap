Hi there! Thanks for contributing. In case you missed it in the main README, this repository will soon be archived.

Moving forward, PRs should be posted as patches to Trac:

1. Create an issue on Trac if one doesn't already exist there. Begin your issue's title with "Twenty Nineteen: ", and select the "Bundled Theme" component. You can create a new issue here:

https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket

2. Submit your changes as a patch to Twenty Nineteen in WordPress core, and attach it to your issue. Instructions for making a patch are here:

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the #core-themes channel on WordPress.org slack.
