Hi there! Thanks for contributing. In case you missed it in the main README, this repository will soon be archived.

Moving forward, issues should be posted to Trac instead:

https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket

When you open an issue there, please begin your issue's title with "Twenty Nineteen: ", and select the "Bundled Theme" component.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the #core-themes channel on WordPress.org slack.
